    \begin{abstract}
    Dependently-typed languages proved to be very useful for statically enforcing properties of programs and for enabling type-driven development.
    And while there's been a lot of work to find the right theoretical foundations for the core type theory, the implementations have been studied to a smaller extent.
    In particular, theoretical works rarely consider the plethora of features that exist in bigger languages like Agda, leading to ad hoc implementations, in particular in the elaborator.
    When these features appear organically over time they can lead to codebases that are hard to maintain.
    We present a new design for the elaboration of dependently-typed languages based on the idea of an open datatype for constraints to tackle these issues.
    This allows for a more compact base elaborator implementation while enabling extensions to the type system.
    We do not require modifications to the core of the type-checker, therefore preserving the safety of the language.

# Introduction #  {#section_introduction}

Strongly-typed languages allow us to specify the behaviour of our programs more precisely.
This comes with the benefit of more static guarantees but with an increased toll on the user to supply more precise information about the program.
Since the type of our program is part of the specification we can use this information to infer parts of our program, following an idea that Connor McBride aptly worded as "Write more types and fewer programs." [@ptoopTypeInferenceThought2022; @mcbrideEpigramPracticalProgramming2005 chap. 2.1]
Somewhat simplistic examples here include overloaded functions in Java, implicits in Scala, and type classes in Haskell.

In dependently-typed languages, our types can be much more precise.
This gives us an even greater opportunity to infer larger parts of our programs from the type in the process of elaboration.
This includes higher-order unification for implicit arguments in Agda, implicit coercions in Coq, and tactic arguments in Idris.
The solving can be not only automatic but also interactive or partially automatic.
For example, holes in Agda, proof obligations and canonical structures [@mahboubiCanonicalStructuresWorking2013] in Coq, and holes in Haskell [@koppelSearchingEntangledProgram2022].
All of these mechanisms use different solvers and have various degrees of extensibility.
They are usually not isolated from each other and can therefore interact in the way the user expects them to (for example, in this case between implicits and instances [@agdausersPerformanceRegressionIssue2018]).

In all of these examples, the solvers evolved organically over time together with the language.
Coq [@thecoqdevelopmentteamCoqProofAssistant2022] invested a lot of effort into user-facing features while having a relatively stable core in the last decade.
However, historically struggling with similar issues in the elaboration: for example, Canonical Structures didn't get to be properly documented for 15 yearsp
[@mahboubiCanonicalStructuresWorking2013].
Agda [@norellPracticalProgrammingLanguage2007] experimented more with features baked into the core of the type system, like sized types which brought their own solver infrastructure [@abelExtensionMartinLofType2016].
Lean 4 is aiming to streamline this process, allowing users to develop new surface-level features [@leonardodemouraLeanMetaprogramming2021] using elaboration monads [@mouraLeanTheoremProver2021], but Lean 3 was built in a more conventional way [@demouraLeanTheoremProver2015a].

These solvers operate on constraints generated by the type-checker.
The constraints say something about as-of-yet unknown parts of the program, which are referred to as metavariables, also known as "existential variables" [@thecoqdevelopmentteamCoqProofAssistant2022, chap. 2.2.1].
We propose a new architecture for an extensible elaborator for dependently-typed languages.
The idea is to provide an API that allows users to tap into the elaboration procedure with their custom solvers that can manipulate metavariables and constraints placed on them.

Contributions:

* We propose a new design blueprint for an extensible language. It supports type classes, implicit arguments, implicit coercions, context arguments a la Scala and tactic arguments.
* We provide a suite of solvers in lieu of common solvers like conversion checker in Agda.
* We suggest a new view on metavariables as communication channels for the solvers.
* We implement a prototype of a dependently-typed language with implicit arguments, type classes, etc.\todo{be honest about implementation}

We hope this goes towards understanding the art and science of implementing dependently-typed languages.
Making the implementations of different features of the language more independent.
This design separates the what the solvers are doing from the when, making it explicit what are the interaction points between them where the developer has to pay attention.

# Unification, constraint-based elaboration and design challanges # {#section_unification_constraint_based_elaboration_and_design_challanges}

Constraints have been an integral part of compilers for strongly-typed languages for a while [@oderskyTypeInferenceConstrained1999].
For example, both Haskell [@vytiniotisOutsideInModularType2011] and Agda [@norellPracticalProgrammingLanguage2007 chap. 3] use constraints extensively.
In the former case, they are even reflected and can be manipulated by the user [@orchardHaskellTypeConstraints2010a; @ghcdevelopmentteamGHCUserGuide2022, chap. 6.10.3].
This has proved to be a good design decision for GHC, as is reflected, for example in the following talk by @peytonjonesTypeInferenceConstraint2019 as well as in a few published sources [@vytiniotisOutsideInModularType2011; @peytonjonesPracticalTypeInference2007].

In the land of dependently-typed languages constraints are much less principled.
Agda has a family of constraints [^agda-constraints-datatype] that grew organically, currently, that's 17 constructors.
Idris technically has constraints [^idris-constraints-datatype] with the only two constructors being equality constraint for two terms and for two sequences of terms.
The same [^lean-constraints-datatype] holds for Lean.
These languages either use constraints in a very restricted, single use-case manner -- for unification, namely -- or in an unprincipled way.
In our view, more methodical approach to constraints will result in a more robust elaborator as a whole.

In this section, we present some typical design challenges that come up while building a dependently typed compiler, the way they are usually solved and what the design blueprint we're suggesting brings to the picture.

## Conversion checking in the presence of a meta-variables ##

Higher-order unification is notoriously hard to implement.
The complexity stems from the desire of compiler writers to implement the most powerful unifier, while being limited by the fact that it higher-order unification is undecidable in general.
This code is also heavily used throughout the compiler, making it sensitive towards changes and hard to maintain and debug. \todo{footnote about Agda CI on cubical and stdlib, Coq on unimath}
Some of this complexity is unavoidable, but we can manage it better by splitting it up into small modular components.
In practice, this means that one doesn't have to fit together an always-growing conversion checker but can instead write different cases separately.
We again rely on the constraint solver machinery to distribute the problems to the fitting solvers.

An example from Agda's conversion checker is `compareAs` [function](https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/v2.6.2.2/src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Conversion.hs#L146-L218) which provides type-driven conversion checking.
The function is almost 90 lines long, and yet the vast majority of it is special cases of metavariables.
This function calls the `compareTerm'` [function](https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/v2.6.2.2/src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Conversion.hs#L255-L386), which itself is 130 lines.
`compareTerm'` calls the `compareAtom` [function](https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/v2.6.2.2/src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Conversion.hs#L419-L675).
Which itself is almost 200 lines of code.
Each of the above functions implements part of the "business logic" of the conversion checker.
But each of them contains a lot of code dealing with bookkeeping related to metavariables and constraints:
1. They have to throw and catch exceptions, driving the control flow of the unification.
2. They have to compute blocking tags that determine when a postponed constraint is retried.
3. They have to deal with cases where either or both of the sides equation or its type are either metavariables or terms whose evaluation is blocked on some metavariables.

This code is unintuitive and full of intricacies as indicated by [multiple](https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/v2.6.2.2/src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Conversion.hs#L430-L431) [comments](https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/v2.6.2.2/src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Conversion.hs#L521-L529).

Zooming in on the `compareAtom` function, the actual logic can be expressed in about [20 lines](https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/v2.6.2.2/src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Conversion.hs#L530-L579) of simplified code. \todo{stripping out size checks, cumulativity, polarity, and forcing}

``` haskell
case (m, n) of
  (Pi{}, Pi{}) -> equalFun m n

  (Sort s1, Sort s2) -> equalSort s1 s2

  (Lit l1, Lit l2) | l1 == l2 -> return ()

  (Var i es, Var i' es') | i == i' -> do
      a <- typeOfBV i
      compareElims [] [] a (var i) es es'

  (Def f es, Def f' es') -> do
      a <- computeElimHeadType f es es'
      compareElims [] a (Def f []) es es'

  (Con x ci xArgs, Con y _ yArgs) | x == y -> do
      t' <- conType x t
      compareElims t' (Con x ci []) xArgs yArgs

  _ -> notEqual
```

\todo{get an example from Idris 2?}

This is precisely what we'd like the compiler developer to write, not to worry about the dance around the constraint system.

## Type-checking function application in the presence of implicit arguments ##

During the type-checking of function application there may be different kinds of arguments to process, for example, instance arguments, implicit arguments, or tactic arguments.
If we start from a simple case of type-checking an application of a function symbol to regular arguments, every next extension requires to be handled in a special case.

Take Agda -- when checking an application during the insertion of implicit arguments [^agda-insertion-of-implicit-arguments] we already have to carry the information on how the argument will be resolved and then create a specific kinds of metavariables [^agda-specific-kinds-of-metavariables] [@norellPracticalProgrammingLanguage2007 chap. 3] - for each of those cases.

Idris 2 [@theidristeamIdrisTutorial2021, chap. 13.1] in the case of `auto` variables  has to essentially do inline the search procedure through a chain of elaboration function calls (`checkApp` to `checkAppWith` to `checkAppWith'`) to `makeAutoImplicit` [^idris2-makeautoimplicit-source].
This can accommodate interfaces (or type classes), but one can imagine that if a different kind of implicit was added, like tactic arguments, or Canonical Structures we'd have to inline the search again, requiring a non-trivial modification to the elaboration mechanism.

[^idris2-makeautoimplicit-source]:
[github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/blob/870bc824371d504a03af937f326216302210a875/src/TTImp/Elab/App.idr#L224-L241](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/blob/870bc824371d504a03af937f326216302210a875/src/TTImp/Elab/App.idr#L224-L241)

[^agda-insertion-of-implicit-arguments]: [github.com/agda/agda/blob/v2.6.2.2/src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Implicit.hs#L99-L127](https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/v2.6.2.2/src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Implicit.hs#L99-L127)

[^agda-specific-kinds-of-metavariables]: [github.com/agda/agda/blob/v2.6.2.2/src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Implicit.hs#L131-L150](https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/v2.6.2.2/src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Implicit.hs#L131-L150)

While the codebases above show that it is certainly possible to extend languages with new features if the language wasn't written with extensibility in mind this can lead to rather ad-hoc solutions.
Instead is of handling every kind of metavariable in a separate way we'd like to uniformly dispatch a search for the solution, which is then handled by the constraint solvers.
We can achieve this by creating metavariables for the unknown terms and then raising a constraint for the meta containing the type of the meta.
Then this constraint can be matched on by the appropriate solver based on the type and the elaborator for the application of a function doesn't have to know anything about the implicits at all.
The only thing we require is that the elaboration of the argument is called with the type information available.
This corresponds to how in bidirectional typing function application is done in the inference mode but the arguments are processed in checking mode.

``` haskell
inferType (App t1 t2) = do
  (et1, Pi tyA tyB) <- inferType t1
  et2 <- checkType t2 tyA
  return (App et1 et2, subst tyB et2)
```

```haskell
checkType (Implicit) ty = do
  m <- createMetaTerm
  raiseConstraint $ FillInTheMeta m ty
  return m
```

This metavariable in its own turn gets instantiated by a fitting solver.
The solvers match the shape of the type that metavariable stands for and handle it in a case-specific manner: instance-search for type classes, tactic execution for a tactic argument.

If it is a regular implicit, however, the only solver that's needed is a trivial one that checks that the metavariable has been instantiated indeed.
This is because a regular implicit should be instantiated by a unification problem encountered at some point later.
This serves as a guarantee that all implicits have been filled in.

Let us go through an example of the elaboration process for a simple term: \todo{remove?}

```
plus  :  {A : Type} -> {{PlusOperation A}}
     -> (a : A) -> (b : A) -> A

instance PlusNat : PlusOperation Nat where
  plus = plusNat

two = plus 1 1
```

We will step through the elaboration of the term `two`.

1. First, the pre-processor eliminates the implicits and type-class arguments.
   We end with the following declarations:
   ```
   plus : (impA : Implicit Type)
       -> TypeClass PlusOperation (deImp impA)
       -> (a : deImp impA) -> (b :  deImp impA)
       ->  deImp impA
   
   PlusNat = Instance {
       class = PlusOperation Nat,
       body = {plus = plusNat}}
   
   two = plus _ _ 1 1
   ```
2. We go into the elaboration of `two` now.
   The elaborator applies `inferType (App t1 t2)` rule four times and `checkType (Implicit) ty` twice on the two placeholders.
   The output of the elaborator is
   ```
   two = plus ?_1 ?_2 1 1
   ```
   And the state of the elaborator contains four more constraints:
   ```
   C1: FillInTheTerm ?_1 (Implicit Type)
   C2: FillInTheTerm ?_2 (TypeClass PlusOperation (deImp ?_1))`
   C3: EqualityConstraint ?_1 Nat Type`
   C4: EqualityConstraint ?_1 Nat Type`
   ```
   
   The first two correspond to implicit arguments.
   The latter two are unification problems rendered into constraints.

3. Now we step into the constraint-solving world.
   First, the unifier solves the latter two, instantiating `?_1` to `Nat`.
   Next, the typeclass resolution launches a search for the instance, resolving `?_2` to the `PlusNat` instance.
   Finally, C1 is discarded as solved since `?_1` is already instantiated to `Nat`.

## Extending unification ##

While writing a unifier is hard enough as it is, at times the developers might want to give their users ability to extend the unification procedure.

Canonical Structures [@saibiOutilsGeneriquesModelisation1999; @mahboubiCanonicalStructuresWorking2013] was already mentioned as it it somewhat in the overlap between type classes and unification hints.
Adding it to a language that doesn't support them requires an extension of unification algorithm with a rule that says that projection from a canonical structure is an injective function [@mahboubiCanonicalStructuresWorking2013, equation 1].

One could also provide means to do so manually in a more general case, by allowing users to declare certain symbols as injective.
This is one of the features requested by the Agda users [@agdausersInjectiveUnificationPragma2023].

Another example of this can be adding rules of associativity and commutativity to the unifier, as described in the thesis by @holtenDependentTypeCheckingModulo2023.


# What is our design bringing into the picture? # {#section_solution_overview}

The examples above show that when building a dependently-typed language while the core might be perfectly elegant and simple, the features that appear on top of it complicate the design.
And while metavariables and unification constraints solve some of them, in the end, it is not a satisfactory resolution.

One can also observe that while the code above might rely on constraints, the design at large doesn't put at the centre of the picture and instead is primarily seen as a gadget.
To give a concrete example, Agda's constraint [solver](https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/v2.6.2.2/src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Constraints.hs#L251-L301) relies on the type-checker to call it at the point where it is needed and has to be carefully engineered to work with the rest of the codebase.

Our idea for a new design is to:

1. Give a stable API for raising constraints so that instead of the type-checker carefully calling the right procedure we raise a constraint, essentially creating an "ask" to be fulfilled by the solvers.

2. Make constraints an extensible data type in the style of "Data types à la carte" [@swierstraDataTypesCarte2008] and give an API to define new solvers with the ability to specify what they match on.

In the examples in this paper, we follow the bidirectional style of type-checking, but in practice, the design decisions are agnostic of the underlying system, as long as it adheres to the principle of stating the requirements on terms in terms of raising a constraint and not by, say, pattern-matching on a concrete term representation.

For the purposes of this presentation, we write a type-checker for a dependently-typed language with support for metavariables and show how to extend it to include implicit arguments, type-classes and potentially other features.
We show more complex features in the [Case Studies](#section_casestudies) section and some basic examples of how the system works below:

For the purposes of the base language it suffices to have the following classes:

``` haskell
-- two terms given should be equal
data EqualityConstraint e =
     EqualityConstraint Syntax.Term Syntax.Term
                        Syntax.Type

-- this terms has to be filled in
data FillInTheTerm e =
     FillInTheTerm Syntax.Term Syntax.Type

data OccursCheck e =
     OccursCheck Syntax.Term Syntax.Type [Syntax.TName]
```

We also provide an additional constraint that is resolved to the equality one: \todo{hash it out in the implementation}

``` haskell
-- the term passed to the constraint should be a type constructor
data TypeConstructorConstraint e =
     TypeConstructorConstraint Syntax.Type
```

The type-checker raises them supplying the information necessary, but agnostic of how they'll be solved.

On the solver side we provide a suite of unification solvers that handle different cases of the problem: \todo{this is mock code, go over it once all is implemented}

Let's take a look at the simplest example -- syntactically equal terms.

``` haskell
-- solves syntactically equal terms
syntacticSolverHandler :: (EqualityConstraint :<: c)
                       => Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
syntacticSolver :: (EqualityConstraint :<: c)
                => Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
syntactic :: Plugin
syntactic  = Plugin { solver  = syntacticSolver
                    , handler = syntacticSolverHandler
                    ...
                    }
```

We first define the class of constraints that will be handled by the solver via providing a "handler" -- function that decides whether a given solver has to fire.
In this case, this amounts to checking that the constraint given is indeed an `EqualityConstraint` and that the two terms given to it are syntactically equal.
Then we define the solver itself.
Which in this case doesn't have to do anything except mark the constraint as solved, since we assume it only fires once it's been cleared to do so by the handler.
The reason for this separation between a decision procedure and execution of it is to ensure separation between effectful and costly solving and cheap decision-making that should require only read-access to the state. \todo{make the types adhere to this paradigm}
Finally, we register the solver by declaring it using a plugin interface.
This plugin symbol will be picked up by the linker and registered at the runtime.

Similarly, we can define solvers that only work on problems where one of the sides is a metavariable:

``` haskell
-- solve cases when one side is a metavariable
unifySolverL :: (EqualityConstraint :<: c)
             => Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
unifySolverR :: (EqualityConstraint :<: c)
             => Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
unifySolverLHandler :: (EqualityConstraint :<: c)
                    => Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
unifySolverRHandler :: (EqualityConstraint :<: c)
                    => Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
...
```

Here the job of the solver is not as trivial -- it has to check that the type of the other side indeed matches the needed one and then register the instantiation of the metavariable in the state.
If both of those steps are successful we can return `True` and the constraint will be marked as solved.

In the cases above we don't have to worry about the order since the problems they match on don't overlap.
In the case they don't we can provide priority preferences:

``` haskell
complexSolver1 :: Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
complexHandler1 :: Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
complexSymbol1 = "complexSolver1"
complex1 = Plugin { ...
                  , symbol   = complexSymbol1
                  , pre = [ unifySolverLS
                          , unifySolverRS]
                  , suc = []
                  }

complexSolver2 :: Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
complexHandler2 :: Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
complexSymbol2 = "complexSolver2"
complex2 = Plugin { ...
                  , symbol   = complexSymbol2
                  , pre = [complexSymbol1]
                  , suc = []
                  }
```

At the time of running the compiler, these preferences are loaded into a big pre-order relation for all the plugins, which is then linearised and used to guide the solving procedure.

From a birds-eye view the architecture looks as depicted in [Figure 1](#architecture-figure) \todo{redraw the diagram in tikz and figure out numbering}

![Architecture diagram](architecture-diagram.svg){#architecture-figure width=50%}


In the diagram type-checker is precisely the part that implements syntax-driven traversal of the term.
It can raise a constraint that gets registered by the Solver Director.
Solver Director then is exactly the component that dispatches solvers on the appropriate constraints and constitutes our main contribution.
All of the components have some read access to the state, including Solver which might e.g. verify that there are no additional constraints on the meta.


# Dependently-typed calculus and bidirectional typing # {#section_bidirectional}

In this section, we describe the core of the type system we implement.
We take pi-forall [@weirichImplementingDependentTypes2022] as a basis for the system and add metavariables and implicits to it.
However, for all other purposes, we leave the core rules intact and therefore, the core calculus too.
This is dependently-typed calculus that includes Pi, Sigma and indexed inductive types.
Equality type isn't defined as a regular inductive type, but is instead built-in with the user getting access to the type and term constructor, but not able to pattern-matching on it, instead getting a `subst` primitive of type `(A x) -> (x=y) -> A y` and `contra` of type `forall A. True = False -> A`.

## Core rules ##

$$
\begin{array}{rcll}
a,b,A,B & ::=& x  &\mbox{ variables  }\\
    && \textbackslash x. a           &\mbox{ lambda expressions} \\
    && a b                           &\mbox{ function applications }\\
    && (x:A) -> B                    &\mbox{ dependent function type }\\
    && Type                          &\mbox{ the `type' of types}\\
\end{array}
$$


## Basic implicits ##

## Open questions ##

Move elsewhere?

* Can we say anything about this calculus? Is type-checking decidable?

# Case-studies # {#section_casestudies}

**Plan**: in this section, we start gradually building up some features while introducing the features gradually while showing parts of the system

## Conversion relation ##

**Plan**:

* show the actual implementation of a simple syntactic solver
* list all the solvers we have for conversion/unification
* describe their interactions with priorities
* memoization of results?

## Implicit arguments ##

**Plan**:

* showcase how exactly the simplest implicits are solved with the unification
* show what we need the pre-processor to produce
  * one option here is what's described in section 1, to translate
    ```
    def f : {a : A} -> B a -> C
    
    def f : (A : Implicit Type)
         -> (a : Implicit (deImp A))
         -> (b : B (deIpm a)) -> C
    ```
  * the other option is to make `Implcit A` compute to `A` and make solvers not eager to reduce.
    In that case `deImp` is unnecessary.
* implement tactic arguments with a custom solver for each tactic, like one that just exhaustively searches constructors

## Type classes ##

**Plan**:

* show what we have to desugar instance and type-class declarations to similar to section 1, but more general
* show the implementation of the solvers
* showcase two alternative definitions of the type-class resolution?
* can we extend this to canonical structures here?

# Limitations # {#section_limitations}

**Plan**: this section is about the limitations of this approach and what doesn't easily fit in this framework

## Handling of meta-variables outside of definition sites ##

After we elaborate a definition there can still be unsolved metas in it.
This presents us with a design choice.
The first option is to freeze the metas and instantiate them per-use site, essentially allowing for an expression to have multiple types.
The second option is to leave them up to be solved later, which might make elaboration less predictable since now the use sites can influence whether a particular definition type-checks.
The third option is to report them as an error and exit immediately.

In particular, the second option allows us to incorporate more involved inference algorithms into the system.
For example, if we were to implement an erasure inference algorithm as described by
Tejiščák [@tejiscakDependentlyTypedCalculus2020], we would have to create metavariable annotations (described as "evars" in the paper) that can be instantiated beyond the definition site.


## The language is only as extensible, as the core is ##

Extensibility via constraints allows for a flexible user-specified control flow as soon as we step into the constraints world.
But control flow of the main body of the basic language elaborator is fixed by the basic language developer.
For example, consider the following simplified [lambda-function typechecking function](https://github.com/agda/agda/blob/v2.6.2.2/src/full/Agda/TypeChecking/Rules/Term.hs#L460-L578) from Agda: \todo{refer to the previous usage of such a function}

``` haskell
checkLambda' cmp b xps typ body target = do
  TelV tel btyp <- telViewUpTo numbinds target
  if size tel < numbinds || numbinds /= 1
    then dontUseTargetType
    else useTargetType tel btyp
```

Here Agda steps away from the bidirectional discipline and infers a (lambda) function if the target type isn't fully known.
If in our design the developer chooses to go only with a pure bi-directional style of type-checking inferred lambda functions would be impossible to emulate.
That is unless one essentially renders macros and writes their own typechecking case for an inferrable lambda.

In order to gain this extra bit of flexibility we provide `inferType` case for lambdas, even though our base language doesn't use it. \todo{actually write this case}

## Eager reduction and reliance on the pre-processor ##

This work crucially relies on a pre-processor of some kind, be it macro expansion or some other way to extend the parser with custom desugaring rules.
In particular, in order to implement n-ary implicit arguments correctly and easily we need the pre-processor to expand them to the right arity.
For coercions, we need to substitute every term `t` in the coercible position for `coerce _ t`.
This can impact performance.

Alternatively, one can imagine a system where constraint solvers are latching onto non-reduced types and terms in constraints.
In that case, we can get around with a trick borrowed from Coq, where `coerce _ t` computes to `_ t`, but since we typechecked an unreduced application the search will still be launched on the right form.

This also means that constraints can/have to match on unreduced types in the e.g. `FillInTheTherm`

We are certainly not the first ones to try to tackle the extensibility of a language implementation.
This section is structured according to the part of the compiler pipeline that allows for extensibility.
Dependently-typed language implementations usually consist of at least four parts:
parser, elaborator, core type-checker, and proper backend.
The back-end part is currently irrelevant to our interests, since for a language to be specified usually means for specification of the core, anything that happens beyond after core doesn't extend the language, but rather tries to preserve its semantics in some form.
Therefore we're left with three parts: parser, elaborator and core type-checker.

We see parser or syntax extensibility as a necessary part of an extensible language.
This problem has been studied extensively in the past and has a multitude of existing solutions.
Macros are one of them and are utilized heavily in various forms in almost all established languages [@thecoqdevelopmentteamCoqProofAssistant2022; @theagdateamAgdaUserManual2022; @ullrichNotationsHygienicMacro2020] and can be powerful enough to build a whole language around [@changDependentTypeSystems2019].

Core extensibility, on the other hand, appears to be a problem with too many degrees of freedom.
Andromeda [@bauerDesignImplementationAndromeda2018; @bauerEqualityCheckingGeneral2020] made an attempt at definitional equality but is quite far from a usable dependently-typed language.
Agda's philosophy allows developers to experiment with the core but also results in a larger amount of unexpected behaviours.
In general, modification of core rules will result in fundamental changes in the type theory, which can break plenty of important properties like soundness or subject reduction.

This leaves us with the question of what can be achieved with the extensibility of an elaborator and why one would need it.
Elaborator is the part of the type-checker that performs said desugaring to translate from the surface to the core language.
This includes type inference, implicit arguments inference, type classes, tactics, and SMT integration.
Elaborators are often structured similarly to the core type-checker, i.e. following a bidirectional discipline of some sort. One can see that in Agda [@norellPracticalProgrammingLanguage2007], Matita [@tassiBiDirectionalRefinementAlgorithm2012], or in a paper by @ferreiraBidirectionalElaborationDependently2014.

Coq [@thecoqdevelopmentteamCoqProofAssistant2022] being one of the most popular proof assistants gained a lot of pace in development from investing effort into user-facing efforts: work on tactics like a new tactic engine [@spiwackVerifiedComputingHomological2011] and tactic languages (Ltac2 [@pedrotLtac2TacticalWarfare2019], SSReflect [@gonthierSmallScaleReflection2008], etc.), the introduction of a virtual machine for performance [@gregoireCompiledImplementationStrong2002] and others.
However, the implementation is quite hard to extend.
One either has to modify the source code, which is mostly limited to the core development team, as seen from the [graph](https://github.com/coq/coq/graphs/contributors).
Or one has to use Coq plugins system.
Which is notoriously hard to get right \todo{this needs a citation} and in the end gave rise to TemplateCoq [@malechaExtensibleProofEngineering2014].

Agda introduced a lot of experimental features, but isn't very modular [@robertestelleHeavyCouplingHaskell2019], which hinders further change. \todo{there's a better argument to be made here}

Lean introduced elaborator extensions [@leonardodemouraLeanMetaprogramming2021; @ullrichNotationsHygienicMacro2020].
They allow the user to overload the commands, but if one defines a particular elaborator it becomes hard to interleave with others.
In a way, this is an imperative view on extensibility.

Idris [@bradyIdrisGeneralpurposeDependently2013; @christiansenElaboratorReflectionExtending2016] appeared as a programming language first and proof-assistant second and doesn't provide either a plugin or hook system at all, except for reflection \todo{citation}.
Idris also focuses on tactics as the main mechanism for elaboration.
Metavariables and constraints-wise in contrast with only one kind of meta and constraints in Idris [@bradyIdrisGeneralpurposeDependently2013 chap. 4.2, chap. 4.3.1].

# Future work #

There are some things we leave for future work.

* Implement erasure inference [@tejiscakDependentlyTypedCalculus2020]?
* Implement Canonical structures [@mahboubiCanonicalStructuresWorking2013]?
* Rendering of macros as constraints?
  Map a macro to an implicit term with the right kind of annotation in the type, to get the right expander as an elaboration procedure?
* Mapping constraint solving onto a concurrent execution model.
  Use LVars here [@kuperLatticebasedDataStructures2015] here, similar to what TypOS [@allaisTypOSOperatingSystem2022a] is doing?
