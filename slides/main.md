\faceA I want to implement a _dependently-typed_ language!

\pause \raggedleft
But do you know what it'll look like? \faceB

\pause \raggedright
\faceA Not completely, but I'll build it in a modular way!

\pause \raggedleft
Making the core modular is _very_ hard... \faceB

\pause \raggedright
\faceA Then you write the base of the elaborator and I'll extend it!

## Slightly more formal

* Can we build an elaborator that is extensible by plugins?
* Core type-checker and language have stay the same
* Parsing is a solved problem

## Elaborator under attack

![](./dependent-types-general.pdf)

## Constraints in Haskell

* Haskell has a "simple" and stable constraint language:
  ```
  W = empty
    | W1, W2 # conjunction
    | C t1 .. tn # type class constraint
    | t1 ~ t2 # equality constraint
    | âˆ€a1..an. W1 => W2 # implication constraint
  ```

## Constraints in Agda

* Agda has a more complex one:
  ```
  W = ValueCmp t1 t2 # eq comparison
    | ElimCmp typ t1 e1 e2 # elim comparison
    | SortCmp s1 s2 # (type) sort comparisons
    | LevelCmp l1 l2 # (type) level comparisons
    | UnBlock m1 # Meta created for a term blocked
    | FindInstance m1 c # type class instances
    | CheckFunDef ... # couldn't check a function def because
    | UnquoteTactic ...
    ... # plenty more
  ```

## Our constraints design

* aiming for something in-between in the core \faceB + your \faceA extensions
  ```
  CoreW = EqualityComparison t1 t2 ty m
        | IsDatatypeConstructor t
        | BlockedOnMeta m tc
        | FillInMeta m
        ...
  ```
* both we \faceB and you \faceA supply the solvers

## Type classes: what's in the core \faceB

``` haskell
inferType (App t1 t2) = do
  (et1, Pi tyA tyB) <- inferType t1
  et2 <- checkType t2 tyA
  return (App et1 et2, subst tyB et2)
```

```haskell
checkType (Implicit) ty = do
  m <- createMetaTerm
  raiseConstraint $ FillInTheMeta m ty
  return m
```


## Type clasess: what does the user write

```
plus : {A : Type} -> {{PlusOperation A}}
    -> (a : A) -> (b : A) -> A

instance PlusNat : PlusOperation Nat where
  plus = plusNat

two = plus 1 1
```

## Type classes: desugaring user input

```
plus : (impA : Implicit Type)
    -> TypeClass PlusOperation (deImp impA)
    -> (a : deImp impA) -> (b :  deImp impA)
    ->  deImp impA

PlusNat = Instance {
    class = PlusOperation Nat,
    body = {plus = plusNat}}

two = plus _ _ 1 1
```

## Type classes: elaborating the program

1. Create the metas:
   ```
   two = plus ?_1 ?_2 1 1
   ```

2. Raise the constraints:
   ```
   C1: FillInTheTerm ?_1 (Implicit Type)
   C2: FillInTheTerm ?_2 (TypeClass PlusOperation (deImp ?_1))`
   C3: EqualityConstraint ?_1 Nat Type`
   C4: EqualityConstraint ?_1 Nat Type`
   ```


## Type classes: writing the plugin \faceA

```haskell
tcHandler :: Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
tcSolver :: Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
tcSymbol = "type class instance search"
tc = Plugin { handler = tcHandler
            , solver  = tcSolver
            , symbol  = tcSymbol
            , pre = []
            , suc = []
            }
```

## Type classes: writing the plugin \faceA

```haskell
tcHandler :: Constraint c -> MonadElab Bool
tcHandler constr = do
  f <- match @FillInTheTerm constr
  case f of
    Just (FillInTheTerm _ (App (TCon "TypeClass") ...)) ->
      return True
    _ ->
      return False
```


## What is this language: base \faceB

* DT language
* Pi, Sigma types
* inductive types with indexes
* case-constructs for elimination (not case-trees)

##  What is this language: additions \faceA

* implicit arguments with placeholder terms
* type classes
* tactic arguments?
* subtyping by coercion?
* row types?

## Current state

[github.com/liesnikov/extensible-elaborator](https://github.com/liesnikov/extensible-elaborator)

* there's a simple unifier implemented
* working on implicit arguments


# Backup slides

## Open questions

* How far can you push these kinds of extensions?
  i.e. can you model erasure inference?
* What if we allow plugins to have a custom store in the monad?
* Can we make the solver parallel?

## Prior work

* Haskell
  * plugins
  * hooks
  * was supposed to get dependent types
* Coq
  * plugins don't really have an interface
  * not restricted in any way, if you go into ml space
  * very confusing
* Lean
  * uses macros to redefine symbols
  * uses reflection and typechecking monads to define custom elaboration procedures
* TypOS
  * you have to buy into a whole new discipline
  * we hope to keep things a bit more conventional engineering-wise

## Old architecture diagram

![](./architecture-diagram.pdf)

## How do you make sure the solvers run in the right order?

specify a (pre-) order in which the solvers should run i.e. type classes run after name disambiguation

## What does a plugin look like?

```haskell
  type PluginId = ...

  type Solver cs = forall m. (MonadSolver cs m) =>
                   (Constraint cs) ->
                   m Bool

  data Plugin cs = Plugin {
    handler :: Handler cs,
    solver :: Solver cs,
    symbol :: PluginId,
    pre :: [PluginId],
    suc :: [PluginId]
  }
```


## Why (bother with splitting)

* at the moment the biggest "usual" solver is a conversion checker
* it typically ranges around 1.7kloc in Idris, Lean, Coq
* in Agda also results in a lot of intricacies in the codebase
* chains of nested calls with logic spread around `compareAs`/`compareTerm`/`compareAtom`
* the need to manually catch and handle constraints at times `catchConstraint`/`patternViolation`

## Why (open it up)

* get a relatively compact core of the elaborator
* build features around it as "extensions" or "plugins"
* allow cheaper experiments with the language
* main inspirations: Haskell [@jonesPracticalTypeInference2007 ; @ghcdevelopmentteamGlasgowHaskellCompiler], Matita [@tassiBiDirectionalRefinementAlgorithm2012]

Bottom line: this is a design study
