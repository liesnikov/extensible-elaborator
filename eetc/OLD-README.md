pi-forall
=========

A demo implementation of a simple dependently-typed language for OPLSS
(Used in 2022, 2014 and 2013)

The goal of this project is to bring up the design issues that occur in the
implementation of the type checkers of languages like Agda, Coq, Epigram, Idris, etc. Of course, it
can't cover everything, but this code is a starting point for discussion.

As its main purpose is didactic, the code itself has been written for
clarity, not for speed. The point of this implementation is an introduction to
practical issues of language design and how specific features interact with
each other.

Installation
----------

  Compiling pi-forall requires GHC and stack
  
  Recommended tools (see links for instructions):
  
  1. [gchup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)
  
  The gchup tool is an installer for general purpose Haskell tools, including GHC, Cabal, Stack and the Haskell language server (HLS). You'll want to install the recommended versions of all of these tools.

  2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Haskell language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell)   


Contents
--------

There are several versions of `pi-forall` in the repository. See the
[documentation](https://github.com/sweirich/pi-forall/blob/2022/doc/oplss.pdf) for an extended description of what parts of the language
are covered by each version.

Each implementation has the following structure:

```
<version>/
  pi/*.pi            example pi-forall files
  src/*.hs           source code
  app/Main.hs        entry point
  README.md (this file)
  LICENSE
  pi-forall.cabal
  stack.yaml

```

To build each version, go to that directory and type:

```
stack build
```

and to typecheck a source file:

```
stack exec -- pi-forall <sourcefile>
```
